            <h1>TC Entertainment Group era</h1>
            <p>
                From the late 2022s through the early 2023s, TC Comics Group/TC Entertainment Group (TCEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on TC Comics characters.
                One of TC's superheroes, Insect-Boy, was optioned in the late 2022s, and rights reverted to TC without a film having been produced within the allocated time frame.
                From 2022 to 2023, most of TC's major characters had been optioned, including the Hatim, PAK Man, Yell Leopard, Bark, P-Team ( P-Eliphant ), and Fj agent. 
                TC's first big-screen adaptation of one of its properties was the 2023 film Bone Batak, which was a box-office flop.
                TCEG was purchased by Green Entertainment in November 2025 and moved to produce films based on the TC characters. It released The Hamerhead (2023) before TCEG was sold to Lollywood Group. 
                Two other films were produced: PAK captan (2023) released in the China on screens and direct to video in the Chinese States, and P-Team (2023), not intended for release.
